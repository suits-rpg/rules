# Colleges and Skills

Skills are your ability to act in the game; almost everything you'd want to do in the game world boils down to a skill. 
Skills are organized in colleges, though many skills appear in more than one college. 
Each skill is based on a specific attribute. The Colleges table is at the end of this page. 

Note that skills are in the adventure school of "If I can do anything in an area, I can do everything in that area". 
While you can sub-specialize all sorts of skills within various fighting techniques, woodcrafts, medicine, law, etc.,
there is no gameplay advantage to that level of depth.

<h2 class="text-sidebar-right__head">Common Ability and Assumed Successes</h2>
<p>Skill training reflects specialized skills; there are plenty of ordinary skills everyone has based on their environment. 
For instance modern characters would all be literate,
be able to drive a car, operate phones and web browsers, etc. 
Medieval characters will all be able to ride horses and shovel poo, etc. 
and literate depending on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy#Ancient_and_medieval_literacy">Circumstances</a>.
</p>
<p>General competence should be assumed.
Its not neccessary to use skill ranks and challenges for everyday activities like driving to work 
or looking up a companies' website. Skill reflects the ability to perform under stress, in contest with others
or to do difficult and challenging tasks. </p>

## Rank and Cards

Your *Rank* in a skill is based on a combination of your base Attribute and any bonus *Levels* you have in a given skill.
For instance if you have a Mind of 6 and Science +2, your effective Rank in Science is 8. 

You can take multiple levels in skills, but you cannot take multiple levels in colleges.

### Default Rank

Your default ability in a skill you have no training in is *half* the base attribute. 
That is, with a mind of 6, you have a base skill of 3 in Medicine even with no training. 

## Performing Skills

There are four types of Skill use in the game: Work Tasks, Tests and Contests. 

### Work Tasks (Grinds)

Some tasks, like chopping wood, spinning wool, or filing forms, are not win/lose paradigms but are simply going to get done. 
They can take longer or shorter, use more or fewer resources, but the end result is not likely to vary significantly. 
Each work task has an expected time/material cost. You can draw to determine your actual output.
When their results are significant (see Common Ability and Assumed Successes) resolve them as follows:

#### Ongoing Work

Some work is ongoing: i.e., the time period is fixed and the expectation is a given quantity of product. 

For ongoing tasks, draw two cards;

* If both of the cards are failures, 50% as much product is generated. 
* If both cards are successes, 150% as much product is generated.
* If one card is a failure and the other is a success, the expected product is generated.

#### Fixed Work

Fixed work is an extended task like building a raft, herding cattle into a corral, etc.
The result is fixed, but the time and/or resources consumed is variable. 

For fixed work. draw two cards. 

* If both of the cards are failures, the task takes 150% as long.
* If both cards are successes, half as long.
* If one card is a failure and the other is a success, the work is done as predicted.

#### Optional: resource consumption

If the resource consumed by the task is variable, draw a third card; 

* On three failures, 150% of the expected consumables are used in the task. 
* On three successes, 75% of the expected consumables are used in the task.

### Tests 

Tests are individual (person vs. task) challenges. Some tasks are instant tests; you either jump the gap or you don't. 
For a Test, you draw a single card against your skill rank. 

Tests are much simpler: you either flat out succeed or fail. Whether a task can be reattempted depends on the situation; 
as as general rule, if you fail at a given task three times in a row it is beyond you. 

### Challenges

Challenges are contests between players. Challenges are documented [here.](/#/Challenges).
