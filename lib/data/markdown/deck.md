# The Deck

SUITS is designed to be played with more than one deck -- a minimum of three decks is recommmended, five is ideal. 

Each player gets a hand of three cards and one action card, meaning 8-24 cards may be out of play at any given moment.
Its expected that players resist the urge to show/talk about their hand. 

The discard pile should be shuffled back into the hand aggressively, potentially, every turn. 

Many of these rules are restatements of the rules found in Challenges and Combat.

## Card Value

When cards are used in tasks or challenges, the value of cards in the range of `A` ... `10` have challenge values
of 1 ... 10 respectively. 

Face cards (`Jack`, `Queen`, or `King`) have the value of 1, 2, and 3, or (at the users' option) 11, 12, and 13.
An exception is that action cards and impact effect cards are always low value. 

## Your Hand 

Every player has a hand of four cards at the start of an engagement. 
Once the action card is played you can maintain a hand of up to three cards at a time. 
On your action you can discard some or all of your hand and redraw three cards which will complete your action for that round.

### Your Action Card

Before the beginning of the first turn each contestant plays one card from their hand as an action card, face down.
Your action card's value indicates which round they act on. Its value is 1 .. 10 (i.e., face cards are low).
If possible play a card not greater than your speed. 

Then Players reveal their action cards and act in the order of highest to lowest action card. 
If your Action Card is above your Speed, tilt it sideways.

#### Turns and Rounds

Play is resolved in turns and rounds. Each Turn is one second of game time. 
It has 10 rounds from 10 to 1(A). Within a round, if you have an (untilted) Action Card equal to the Round's rank,
you can act; resolve ties in descending order of Speed, resolving ties with a random draw from the deck.

#### Tilted Action Cards

Each character tilts their action card sideways when they act to track who has and has not acted.
If you begin the first round with an Action Card above your Speed, 
tilt your card sideways to indicate you cannot act that round.

At the end of the turn, untilt all Action Cards. 

#### Cooldown 

For those that have cooldown penalties, you may have one or more delays to your ability to act. 
These are represented by one or more facedown cards (or white poker tiles) placed half-over their action cards.
On your action round, remove one facedown card from your action card; that is all you can do that round. 

##### Mandatory Cooldown

If you have cooldown because you are surprised, dazed, waking up, or whatever, you don't have control over your 
action until you shake down this cooldown. 
You must take rounds to remove cooldown until it is all removed in order to regain control over your own character.

##### Optional Cooldown

There are a few types of cooldown that can be delayed; in particular, unready weapons. 
While you probably *should* ready an unready weapon on your turn, there are other things you can do --
move, drop the weapon and draw another one, check your watch, sing a song...
as long as you don't do the one thing you can't do while your weapon is unready -- attack with that weapon -- you can choose
when or if to spend a round slogging off your cooldown. 

Another type of optional cooldown is getting knocked down. 
It takes two turns to stand up after getting knocked down 
(that is one to go from flat on your ass to crawling, one turn to stand up)
but if lying on your ass or crawling, something you like doing, you can choose when and if to crouch up and stand. 

### Playing Cards from your Hand

When responding to a challenge you can
 
1. play one or more cards from your hand, or
2. draw a single card from the deck. 

The details of this is spelled out in Challenges. 

### Refreshing your hand

It takes a round to refresh your hand. 
When you do so, you can discard any number of cards (or your entire hand) and draw from the deck until you have three cards.
There is never an obligation to refresh your hand; if you like drawing from the deck, you can continue acting indefinately
without any cards in your hand. 

### Your hand and damage

When you take any impact past your armor, you lose all your cards. 
If you take/have any Damage, you lose the ability have any cards in your hand. (your wounds are diminishing your effectiveness).

## Henchmen and hands

To avoid keeping a lot of hands in play, henchmen don't get hands. 
Instead, they get the ability to draw a second card if their first card is a face card. 
They lose this ability once they take any Damage. 
Once a Henchman takes damage, face cards have their usual value when drawn. 

-------

&#42; An exception: if you have a stupendous skill in the 11-13 range you can CHOOSE to have a face card
from your hand have its high value.
I.e., if you have a skill of 14, you can play a Queen from your hand and have it's value be 12.
