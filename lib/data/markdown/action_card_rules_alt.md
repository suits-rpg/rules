## Your action card

Activity is measured in rounds. 
In tactical situations rounds are one second long; other contests may have a more relaxed clock. 
Your action card indicates which phase in the round you can act. 
In ordinary circumstances, anyone with cards in their hand can act once per round.

<h2 class="text-sidebar-right__head">Long actions</h2>

<p>Some actions, like using unbalanced weapons, aiming raged weapons, casting long spells, bows, etc., 
require more than one action to execute. 
To perform long actions, place a card from the deck below your action card. You can use poker chips
if you have them instead of cards to track long actions.

<p>When you have enough cards/chips to act you act as usual on the phase of the action card, discarding
your action card and tokens and swapping your skill card as above. 

<p>Whether a long action can be maintained from turn to turn depends on the circumstance. 
Aiming, for instance, can be maintained over subsequent turns, as can a readied weapon. 
Bandaging a wound must be executed immediately or the effort is lost. 

<p>You cannot perform a long action unless you have cards in your hand.

### Your action phase

Players act in descending order of action card values; 
in a tie, they act in descending order of Speed.
Face cards as action cards are always low. 

Things you can do on your action include:

* Challenge an opponent
* Perform a task
* Replenish your deck
* Perform a generic action 

### Replacing your action card

If you don't have an active action card, you have no action phase that turn.
At the end of the round when you can place down an action card face down
to be flipped up at the beginning of the next round.

If you have no action card *and no cards in your hand* 
you can draw a card from the deck face down as your action card.

### Swapping your skill card

When you act, you discard your action card and replace it with the highest card in your skill card(s), placed face down. 
You do not have to reveal which card you chose if you had multiple cards.
This is true even if you fail your skill check.

This is only nessecary if your action requires a skill check (i.e., tests and challenges). 
If your action is to move, fiddle with your gear, drink a potion, etc., your action card is not swapped. 
You can keep the same action card indefinately until you perform a skil based task or challenge.
