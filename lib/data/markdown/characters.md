# Characters

A character is any sentient entity in the game; this include animals, people, player avatars, henchmen, etc. 

## Base Attributes

Characters all have the same fundamental attributes. 
These attributes range from 0..10; most humans have attributes in the range of 4-6. 

### Speed

Athletic skill, reflexes and movement. The basis for most physical skills. 

### Will 

Social skills, pain threshold, and empathy. Also serves as the basis for paranormal power. 

### Mind

Intelligence, perception, and memory. The basis for most mental skills. 

### Body

Your health, damage resistance, and physical strength. 

## Skills

Skills define the activity your character is proficient in. They are organized in colleges. Each skill is based on an 
attribute. Purchasing a skill once gives you a rank equal to that base attribute. Each level of skil purchased past that 
increases your rank at that attribute by one level. Purchasing colleges has the same effect for all skills within that college.

One detail: skils can appear in multiple colleges; if you have multiple colleges with the same skill, you get the best
rank based on the college with the most levels; the other colleges have no effect on your proficiency.

## Generating Characters

There are two ways to generate characters:
 
### Point-based Characters

Players can purchase character ability with using Ability Points. Typical characters
start with 30 points. 

* Skills cost one Ability Point to acquire and 2 points per extra level. 
* Colleges cost four Ability Points
* Attributes are purchased on a increasing AP scale:

### Random Characters

Characters can be generated by drawing 10 cards; face cards (Jack, Queen and King) count as two cards.

#### Tweaking the draw 

If by some fluke no face cards are drawn, you can convert one non-face card 
in a suit in which you have two or more cards
into a face card and discard any one other card (to cover the cost of conversion). 

You can do this multiple times if you wish. 

You can do this in reverse as well, discarding a face card in a suit in which you have two or more cards and drawing
two new cards, discarding face cards. 

For a given suit, you can't tweak in both directions; i.e., you can discard a face card or convert non-face-cards
into face cards, but you can't do both.
