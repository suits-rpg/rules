# SUITS: the playing card based Role Playing Game

SUITS is a role playing game. Its not an acronym but its' awesome enough to be spelled in ALL CAPS. 
Its intended for tabletop gameplay and relatively casual play style camplaigns. 

SUITS is a role playing game designed to be played with [playing cards] (/#cards).
It is not based on any particular background; like GURPS or Hero Systems
it is designed to be used in any environment though its basic target 
is a fairly real-world based setting. 

SUITS is a Tabletop Role Playing game. Says Wikipedia:

SUITS is incomplete by design; there are plenty of areas where interpretation 
is done by the players. The skils are designed to be broad and overarching.
