# SUITS

Suits is an RPG played with cards; ideally, 2+ decks. 

## Contests

Contests are between two people each of whom have a relevant skill and power level; these
are either based on skills, or raw attributes. Note, the average skill/power level is 5
with ranges of +/-3 being normal. 

In a contest, you draw a card for each contestant. If the card you draw is above your skill
you lose the contest; if both people overdraw the contest, there is no outcome and you will
continue to another round.  

the numeric value of face cards are varying based on the "blackjack rule"; at the holder's option: 

* Aces are 1 or 11
* Jacks are 2 or 12
* Queens are 3 or 13
* Kings are 4 or 14

#### Skill Modifiers

Sometimes your skill is modified by bonus cards, the awkwardness of your weapon, wounds, etc.
You cannot be penalized past 1/4 of your skill. Use the Power chart below to determine your skill
based on its base and the fractional penalty you are suffering. 

The worst defense you can have -- even if you are totally ambushed, blind, etc., is 2. 

#### Instant vs. Extended contests

Some contests for simple/mundane tasks can be resolved with simple contests of skil; 
extended contests, like combat, involve depleting the contestants' power pool 
until one of them reaches Loss equal to twice their Power. 

### Order of action

Everyone gets a card (or cards). If you want to draw multiple cards, you get a chip (or facedown
card) for the overdrawn cards. 

Actions go in descending order of skill. In the case of a tie, go in descending order of
weapon length, then by ascending order of loss; then, draw a card for each contestant
and keep that value for their order number, putting the card back in the discard pile. 

You do not HAVE to act at the same level as your card; if there is a reason you want to 
delay, you can act in a phase below your skill. 

If multiple people attempt to act at the same level, they act in ascending order of skill - loss. 
If attacks are made within the group at the same level, the target MUST redraw their defensive card. 
(This is known as a "Skill Stomp"). 

If you have multiple cards you act on the round for the value of all your cards. 
If your skill is over 13, (and you can,) you can act on the "K" round. 

#### Defensive Modifiers

Ordinarily, when to fighters are in contest, one of them gets a hit each round (unless
both contestants overdraw). If you have a defensive mod you have two numbers in a contest:
your offensive value (the base value of the card) and a defensive value (your card + defense). 
If your opponent draws above your base value but below or equal to your defensive value,
there is no result to the contest. 

Your maximum Defensive Modifier is 3. 

#### Redraw Defense

If you have already acted, whether or not you initialized the action, you cannot re-use
that card's value again in another contest. You must draw a card from the deck to use 
in subsequent contests 

#### Minimal defense 

For some actions you may have a rating below your base attribute. However, in all cases
the lowest possible skill defense is your base attribute. 

### Multiple Cards

Ordinarily one card per contestant is drawn. However there are some circumstances where
extra cards may be in order:

If you have a very high skill (or are very desperate) you can draw two or three cards.

If the sum of the cards are are above your skill, you lose the contest, and give your
opponent a chance at a brilliant victory. 

If you draw within your skill level, however, you may receive multiple bonuses for face cards.

You cannot both draw multiple cards and add to your Bonuses. However, you CAN both
draw multiple cards and uses Bonuses on the same turn.

### N00b warz

Contests with extremely low-skilled contestants can be a lot of mutual failing. In those situations
(where both contestants are below 5 in skill) each contestant can draw two cards and keep the 
highest single card within their skill level. 

You can't have a N00b war and uses bonuses, nor can you use multiple cards (as above) in a
N00b warz. For the purposes of tracking time, every N00b warz round is twice the length of a 
normal round. 

A N00b with a slow weapon still draws two cards but can only attack every other round. 

This mechanic is just a means to accelerate the outcome in unskilled battles. There is no
way to have a N00b warz when any person with a decent (6+) skill is involved. 

The cutoff is based on effective skill; if for instance two people with awkward weapons
may have base skills of 5, but 

### Power Bonus

The winner receives a power bonus (see below) based on the suit of their card. 
If they have multiple cards they get the _single best_ bonus for any suit in their cards. 
Note -- the power bonus is based on the weapon's power, computed by the power factor;
that is, the power factor of the weapon determines the base power, and then _that_ value
is indexed by the power offset from the contest suit(s). 

Note, regardless of the modifier sums, the maximum range of your power bonus is +/-3. 

* +0 for clubs
* +1 for spades
* +2 for hearts
* +3 for diamonds

If the defender doesn't overdraw, they get a negative bonus for their card: 

* -3 for clubs
* -2 for Spades
* -1 for hearts
*  0 for diamonds

So, the "worth" of the suit of the card depends a lot on whether you win or lose...

### Face card bonus

Additionally, face cards add to your power bonus. If you have multiple face cards 
add the bonus for _each_ face card. This only applies to the winner of the contest.

* +1 for Aces
* +2 for Jacks
* +3 for Queens
* +4 for Kings

#### Power Phase

Power is a general term for the attribute that is relevant to the contest. For mental contests the 
attribute is Will; for physical contests the attribute is Body. 

Once the winner is determined, they calculate the effect their conquest has on their target.
Calculate the winner's power (detailed below) and add that amount to the losers' status.

#### Loss

Loss is the amount of you lose as the consequence of losing 

* Any single contest in which you suffer loss above your base power; the difference is   
  Major Loss (wounds, in combat).

Note that Loss is a general term for a value that is split between Minor and Major Loss.
(in combat, Shock and Wounds). 
* Major Loss persists for the length of the contest, and possibly to subsequent contests.
* Minor Loss is short term shock and recovers during the contest; all of it is recovered
  at the end of the contest. 

Your Status is the sum of your Minor and Major loss. When your Status is > 2x your Power,
you lose the contest. 

Is this more complicated than a single stack of hit points? Yes; however, this results in 
far fewer fatalities; death is the result of a single extremely powerful hit or several significant
hits, rather than an inevitable result of all trauma regardless of intensity. Low powered combat,
or combat with significant armor, is far more likely to result in the collapse of the user
than a guaranteed fatality. 

##### Damage type and loss

The above rules apply to Hard weapons. 

* Cutting weapons cause Wounds past 75% of your Body (round up). 
* Piercing weapons cause Wounds past 50% of your Body (round up).
* Blunt weapons cause half as many wounds (round down). 

For instance, a person of body 7 takes 8 points of damage. 

* If the damage was hard, they would take 1 point of Wound and 6 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Cutting, they would take 3 points of Wound and 5 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Piercing, they would take 4 points of Wound and 4 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Blunt, all 8 points would be shock. 

Keep in mind, as described below, ALL loss that puts your status past 2 x Body is taken
as Wounds.

##### Recovery from Minor Loss

You can recover minor loss at the end of any round in which you do not attack or lose
a contest. Even if you take no loss past armor, losing a contest prevents recovery. 
You can defend and recover, but you cannot strike offensively and recover in the same turn. 

Since you can see your card before playing it and recover at the end of the round, 
you can decide whether to recover stun after looking at your card.

If you have not taken any wounds you recover
* 2 points of Loss if your card is below or equal to your Will. 
* 1 point of Loss if your card is above your Will. 
* no recovery if your card is above 1/2 your Wounds. 

Note, for this purpose, face cards are _always high_.

If you have taken wounds you recover one point of Shock only if your card is below or 
equal to your Will.

###### Dazed

This "Can" becomes "Must" when your Status is greater than your Power. (or Will in combat). 
When you have accumulated Status loss past your threshold, you are Dazed; 
you _must_ forfeit action to recover from Shock until all your shock has been recovered.  

You cannot act again until either:
* You have recovered all your Minor Loss (regardless of Wounds)
* Your Status (Minor + Major loss) is brought to or below your Will.

At this point you are no longer Dazed and can opt to attack or recover as desired.

##### Wounds (Major Loss)

Minor Loss (Shock) can be recovered from relatively quickly. However a single large loss --
one that is greater than your Power -- causes Major Loss. If You accumulate Major Loss
equal to your Power, you lose the contest immediately. 

Example: a long term two-person car race, based on Speed (for skill) and Will (for Power) 
goes on several rounds. In a particularly vicious round, Bob (Speed 6, Will 5) 
takes a loss of 7. Two of those points of loss are Major Loss; the other 5 are Minor. 

The next round, Bob is Dazed and must recover. If he draws under his Will he recovers
2 points of Minor loss; since his Status is now 5 (3 points Minor, 2 points Major) 
he is no longer Dazed and can compete normally. If not he will be at Status 6 
(4 points Minor, 2 points Major) he is still Dazed and will be forced to recover 
for one more round. 

#### Defeat

You lose a contest if you either accumulate total Loss (Status) greater than twice your
Power, or Major Loss equal to your Power.

In combat, there are other specific effects for crossing thresholds.

       ,         , >Will , >Body    , >2 x Body 
         
Status , Total   , Dazed ,          , KO

Wounds , Total   ,       , Critical , Death
       , At Once ,       , Death    , Mangled
          
Dazed:    Must recover Shock
Critical: Disabled; bleeding
Dead:     See Below
Mangled:  Completely destroyed

#### Unconsciousness

When your status -- the sum of your wounds and shock -- exceeds twice your body, you are unconscious. 
Unconsciousness lasts a few minutes; however, you won't be very effective (Half all skills) 
without a good night's sleep. 

#### Critically Wounded

Wounds past Body are considered Critical Wounds. You fall to the ground, and can no longer defend yourself. 
If attacked again, the attacker automatically hits, so you don't get the power effect from your defense.

Every turn in which you have critical wounds, draw a card:

* If you draw under your Critical Wounds, you bleed for another point of damage. 
  (this is a normal Wound, not critical.) 
  Also, draw a second card under your Will - Critical Damage or pass out. 
* If you draw over your Critical Wounds but under your Body, 
  one point of Critical Wounds stabilizes (and becomes a normal non-critical wound). 

If the sum of your critical and normal Wounds is over twice your body, you die. 

A medic can prevent bleeding by drawing under their skill - the subject's critical wounds. 
If successful, they prevent the bleeding. On a turn in which you do NOT bleed, 
they can attempt to stabilize a second point of Critical Wounds. 

#### Death 

Death occurs when you take a single hit causing wounds over your body, 
or accumulate wounds greater than twice your body. 

How dead is dead is something the gamemaster can arbitrate. Monsters and Sidekicks die like
tadpoles. At the referee's discretion, heroes can struggle on as critically wounded 
until they reach Body x 3 wounds; or minimally, if you take a single hit of >Body wounds,
til your wounds is above Body x 2 wounds. 

Mangled, on the other hand, is a dramatic, messy death; 

#### Healing

If you are resting, you automatically heal a point of Wounds every day; 2, if you draw under Body - Wounds. 
If your wounds are greater than your body, you heal 1 point of Wounds if you draw under Body * 2 - Wounds, 
and 1/2 a point of Wounds if you do not. 

If you are under the care of a doctor, they can heal another 1/2 point of wounds every day they draw under their Skill
 - your Wounds. They must spend at least an hour tending you, so a doctor can help multiple people per day. 

### Your Power Bonus

Loss is calculated from a combination of the attackers' sheer power (Body * Weapon Leverage + Weapon Boost (if any)),
adjusted by the suit of their card and the defenders' card. 

The sum of all the above bonuses is added and cross indexed on the scale below. Round up at or past
0.5. Power Bonuses cannot be lower than -3. 

Its best to pre-compute a weapons' effect from -3 to +3. This chart should help:

 2,    1 1/2,   2,   3,   5,   6,   8,   9,  11,  12,  14,  15
 
 3,    1 3/4,   2,   4,   5,   7,   9,  11,  12,  14,  16,  18
 
To compute basis for powers > 10, use power 10 + power remainder.

For instance: 

A medium Sword (80% body) is used by a person of Body 6; it has power 5. 
Power 5's range on the table below is 

Weapon   -3  -2  -1  (0)  +1  +2  +3

SWORD     1, 2,  3,  (5)  6,  8, 9  Cutting
 
A Warhammer (125% body - 1) is used by a person of Body 6; it has a power 7, and is 33% AP.
Power 7's range on the table below is:
 
Weapon   -3  -2  -1  (0)  +1  +2  +3

WARHAMMER 2,  4,  5,  (7)   9,  11, 12  Hard, AP 33%

The Warhammer seems on a pure power basis to be superior, especially against armor. 
However the cutting weapon will cause more

             Power is halved every two yards in open air.

Burst weapons are resolved in clumps of 4. The number of bullets that hit depend on range, 
and the suit of a second card:

AIMING

If you have a line of sight to your target (or where you know your target is -- i.e.,
the garbage can they are hiding in) you can aim for one or more rounds to increase
your chance of hitting them. 

Once you aim at a target you can fire at any point you want; however you have to wait
until your normal action round to add a card to your aiming for that round.

You can also aim at an area and shoot anyone that comes in, but you will get one fewer
card for area coverage for a 15 degree arc, two fewer cards for a 30 degree arc. 
You can cover up to a 60 degree arc, but you won't get any cards. 

Aiming grants you an extra card per turn of aim at short and point blank range,
per two turns at medium range and beyond. When you fire, you can take the best single
card; on a tie, you must take the earliest card drawn. 

If you have three or more cards, you can take the best COMBO of two or more cards;
on a tie, you must take the one based on the earliest card drawn. 

You can aim for a maximum of (Base Skill /2, round down) rounds. You can maintain 
your aim indefinitely, but you will not accrue additional bonus cards.
 
MINIMUM WEAPON STRENGTH

If you are under strength for a Body it is awkward; or more awkward as it may be.  
it you are at 75% minimum Body or below you cannot use a weapon at all.

+ an absolute absorption boost. 
OnBlock: defensive benefit only if the defender doesn't overdraw their skill.
Awkward: -25% to users Speed/Skill, with a minimum -1 penalty.
Slow: adds an extra round of recovery after a successful attack. When readying a slow 
      weapon you still can defend normally. 
Note - awkward and slow modifiers combine. 

## Bonus Cards (optional) 

To add a little strategy, when you get a face card, you can choose to receive a bonus card
to be played in a later round. If you do that, you cannot act this round but can defend with 
a newly drawn card. 

This only counts when you draw a face card directly from the deck AND when you did not 
draw more than one card that turn. In other words you cannot use Bonuses and acquire Bonuses
in the same round. 

To keep the deck from getting skewed from big hands, you can track your bonus cards with
white chips. which you apply when desired to boost your abilities in a particular round. 

The bonus you get depends on the suit of the card and whether you choose to use it
offensively or defensively. You must commit to use your bonus(es) 
(and announce which are offensive and which are defensive). 

You can choose when/if to reveal and enable their effects
as long as you use them on the same turn on which they are drawn. 

Note, all card effects for multiple bonuses affect a single person; you, or a single opponent. 

The effects last through that round and are discarded at the end of the round. 

       ,    Club,            Spade,            Diamond,           Heart
       
Offense,    Extra Action,    +2 Skill,         Opp. Armor -2,    +1 Power Bonus
Defense,    Slow Opponent,   -2 Opp. Skill,    Armor +2,         -1 Power Bonus to Opp.

### Club: 

#### Extra Action:  

after everyone has acted, you can perform an extra action. You can do
anything you would do normally in an action and receive a new card to act with. 
Your targets must draw a new defense card if necessary. No matter how many clubs you draw
you can never get more than one extra action (with the sole exception noted below). 

If any other hand card bonuses are in play (yours or your opponents) they carry over to 
this extra act phase as well.

The only way that multiple clubs come into play is if you have a slow weapon or a weapon
like a bow that requires reloading. You can use one club to ready your weapon/arrow/etc.
and another club to act on it. Or, you can use it and re-ready it instantly for the next 
round. However even in this circumstances, you can only use two clubs; 
you can't ready, act, and ready again for instance.

#### Slow Opponent: 

your opponent stumbles, and loses their next action. 
They can act defensively, but are immobilized and cannot act offensively during their next act.
You can delay an opponent multiple times to keep them stumbling for multiple rounds.

### Spade: 

+2 skill/-2 opponent skill: 

Add or subtract to your/their skill. 
This doesn't affect the value of your card 
but it does increase the range of cards that are valid without overdrawing. 
You cannot lower an opponents' skill below 50% of their base skill with these cards.

### Diamond:

+2 armor/-2 opponent armor;

Increase your armor value (even if you don't have armor. Even if you don't have Armor
you can gain temporary 1 point of Armor Absorption.
If your opponent has no armor to lose, treat as a Heart. 

### Heart: 

+1/-1 Power Bonus. Add this to the Suit bonus value when determine weapon effect.
