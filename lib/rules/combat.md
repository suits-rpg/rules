# Contests and Combat

Contests are between two people each of whom have a relevant skill and power level; these
are either based on skills, or raw attributes. Note, the average skill/power level is 5
with ranges of +/-3 being normal. 

In a contest, you draw _two_ cards for each contestant. 
* If both cards are above your skill,  you "overdraw" and lose. 
* If either or both card is under your skill, you can use the highest as your rank. 
* If the _sum_ of the cards is under your skill, that is your rank. 

## Fast Attacks, two weapons. 

Some weapons get multiple attacks per round; these include pistols, automatic weapons, etc.
Optionally, if you have two weapons in hand, you can gain multiple attacks.
Note, even if you HAVE two weapons, attacking with both weapons in one round is optional 
and must be declared prior to drawing. 

In all cases having a second weapon in hand is +1 Defense, except vs. ranged weapons. 
This is true regardless of whether or not you opt for a second attack. 

* Anyone can attack with two weapons as long as one of them is small. 
* A hand to hand fighter whose Body equals the Sum of the minimum strength of both weapons 
  can attack with larger weapons, as long as neither are slow. 

A multiple attack is successful only if 

* the two cards are sequential in rank (a 4 and a 5, an King (4) and a 3, etc.
* the highest card drawn is still a successful attack. 

## Multiple Shots

Guns with autofire (assault rifles, machine guns, most modern pistols) attack multiply by design.  
With automatic weapons, each shot(or burst) is a single draw, and with each successive draw your 
skill goes down by 1/2 at PB range, 1 at short range, 2 at medium range, and 4 at long range. 

If you opt to shoot more than once in a round, each shot is resolved with a single card.

If you have multiple guns WITH multiple shots the gun in your off hand is at 1/2 skill. 

* Firing two-handed with multi shot 

## Minions

Draws can get pretty tedious with minions. For faster play, minions only get one card, get no
bonus for face cards (as in optional rules). If the minions are legion you can even break them into 
groups of four and only draw for every group; as in, "Minion 1, 5, and 9 draws a 4..."

### Swarms 

Some minions are so numerous that attacking individually is not feasible. For them, you can break them into 
swarms, whose base attack rating is augmented by their population. For instance, a herd of kittens 
may only attack at skill 3, but for every 4 kittens, their skill goes up by 1. 

Attacking a swarm is also hard, because they are tiny; they may have a high defense (say, 7) that goes 
_down_ by each additional kitten. You kill one kitten for winning, +1 for every full 2 points of 
marginal success. so if you draw a 10 and they draw a 3, you kill 4 kittens (1 at 4, 6, 8, and 10);

The downside, most armor is not swarm-proof. You get at best 33% of your armor's defense against swarms.

## Card Value

the numeric value of face cards are varying based on the "blackjack rule"; at the holder's option: 

* Aces are 1 or 11
* Jacks are 2 or 12
* Queens are 3 or 13
* Kings are 4 or 14

Note there are some circumstances where the face card is _always_ high; this is noted as a "high draw".

## Skill Modifiers

Sometimes your skill is modified by bonus cards, your weapon modifiers, wounds, etc.
You cannot be penalized past 1/4 of your skill.

The worst defense you can have -- even if you are totally ambushed, blind, etc., is 2. 

## Instant vs. Extended contests

Some contests for simple/mundane tasks can be resolved with simple contests of skil; 
extended contests, like combat, involve depleting the contestants' power pool 
until one of them reaches Loss equal to twice their Power. 

In non-combat contests when you take 2x Power loss, you lose; the last man standing is the victor.

Combat has a more complex system of loss, weapons and armor. 

### Order of action

For the first round, everyone draws a card; if that card is under your reflexes, you act in descending order 
of the card value. If it is not, you still act on that phase, but do not act on the first round. 

If you have a slow weapon, halve your skill for this purpose.

Note the order of action, with overdraws in parentheses. 

You do not HAVE to act at the same level as your card; if there is a reason you want to 
delay, you can act in a phase below your skill. 

If multiple people attempt to act at the same level, they act in ascending order of skill. redraw to resolve ties.

If there are large numbers of identical minions, they can be grouped in clusters of 2 - 4 each to determine order. 
Ideally, break up the clusters so that they are made of minions in different locations to reduce coordinated advantage.

### Defensive response

If two people engage in a contest, regardless of who started it, both people are considered to act for that turn. 
The exception is that if the person who is acted upon is outnumbered, they may engage in the contest defensively. 
Put another way, if you are attacked by three people, you must defend against two of them and engage with one; 
however, you don't have to engage someone that attacks you; you can choose to respond with a defense only, and attack
another combatant. 

You must declare your choice to respond defensively before you look at your cards. 

If you opt to defend, you can use one of your cards for defense and save the other for your action. 
However, you cannot defend against and attack the same person in the same round; 
i.e., you cannot participate in two contests with the same person in a round.
Alternatively you can use the sum of both of your cards for defense. 

You can choose whether to use one or two cards after looking at your cards. 

* If you successfully defend, they can still act on their turn with the second card. 
* if your opponent wins the contest, you lose their ability to act on their action, and must discard the other card.
  (i.e., if you both overdraw you can still act.)
* If you are playing with a single deck, the defender must return their card to the deck and draws a single card for their action. 

If you are engaged when you have no cards left, you can draw a one or two cards from the deck in defense; however,
if you draw two cards, you _must_ use the sum of the cards, or overdraw and lose the contest. 

The option to respond defensively is not available to the person who initiated a contest. 

### Engagement

Once you have begun a contest with a person, you can only disengage if 

* your opponent(s) is/are outnumbered by your allies
* all your opponents did not attack you last round, or overdrew their attack

#### Power Phase

Power is a general term for the attribute that is relevant to the contest. For mental contests the 
attribute is Will; for physical contests the attribute is Body. 

Once the winner is determined, they calculate the effect their conquest has on their target.
Calculate the winner's power (detailed below) and add that amount to the losers' status.

### Power Bonus

The winner receives a power bonus (see below) based on the suit of their card. 
If they have multiple cards they get the _single best_ bonus for any suit in their cards. 
Note -- the power bonus is based on the weapon's power, computed by the power factor;
that is, the power factor of the weapon determines the base power, and then _that_ value
is indexed by the power offset from the contest suit(s). 

Note, regardless of the modifier sums, the maximum range of your power bonus is +/-3. 

Each +/- adjusts the loss the winner inflicts on the loser by 25%; so if your base power is 
8 and your power bonus is 2, you inflict 12 loss on your opponent. 

#### Bonus for suit

The winner's power bonus is based on the _single best_ suit in the cards they use.

* +0 for clubs
* +1 for spades
* +2 for hearts
* +3 for diamonds

Additionally, face cards add to your power bonus. If you have multiple face cards 
add the bonus for _each_ face card you use in the contest.

* +1 for Aces
* +2 for Jacks
* +3 for Queens
* +4 for Kings

If the defender doesn't overdraw, they get a negative bonus for their _single best_ card: 

* -3 for clubs
* -2 for Spades
* -1 for hearts
*  0 for diamonds

Additionally, if the defender doesn't overdraw, they get a negative bonus for _each_ face card
they use in defense.

* -1 for Aces
* -2 for Jacks
* -3 for Queens
* -4 for Kings

So, the "worth" of the suit of the card depends a lot on whether you win or lose...

#### Loss

Loss is the amount of you lose as the consequence of losing a contest. 

Any single contest in which you suffer loss above your base power; the difference is   
Major Loss (wounds, in combat); the remainder is Minor Loss (or Shock, in combat). 

Note that Loss is a general term for a value that is split between Minor and Major Loss.
(in combat, shock and wounds). 
* Major Loss persists for the length of the contest, and possibly to subsequent contests.
* Minor Loss is short term shock and recovers during the contest; all of it is recovered
  at the end of the contest. 

Your Status is the sum of your Minor and Major loss. 

* When your status (Major + minor loss) is over 2x your Power, you lose. 
* When your Major Loss is over your Power you lose. 

Is this more complicated than a single stack of hit points? Yes; 
however, this makes fatal results rarer and more plausible.
Death is the result of a single extremely powerful hit or several significant hits, 
rather than an inevitable result of all trauma regardless of intensity. 
Low powered combat, or combat with significant armor, 
is far more likely to result in the collapse of the user than a guaranteed fatality. 

##### Damage type and loss

The above rules apply to Hard weapons. 

* Cutting weapons cause Wounds past 75% of your Body (round up). 
* Piercing weapons cause Wounds past 50% of your Body (round up).
* Blunt weapons cause half as many wounds (round down). 

For instance, a person of body 7 takes 8 points of damage. 

* If the damage was hard, they would take 1 point of Wound and 6 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Cutting, they would take 3 points of Wound and 5 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Piercing, they would take 4 points of Wound and 4 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Blunt, all 8 points would be shock. 

Keep in mind, as described below, ALL loss that puts your status past 2 x Body is taken
as Wounds.

##### Recovery from Minor Loss

You can recover minor loss on your action phase if you have not acted offensively or lost
a contest since your last action. This includes winning a contest you did not initiate.
Even if you take no loss past armor, losing a contest prevents recovery. 

Recovering minor loss requires a High Draw against your base power. In combat it requires a draw
against your Will.

If you have not taken any wounds you recover

* 2 loss if your card is below or equal to your Will. 
* 1 point of Loss if your card is above your Will. 
* 0 points of loss if the card is above 2x your will.

Add any Major Loss to the cards' value. 

###### Dazed

This "Can" becomes "Must" when your Status is greater than your Power. (or Will in combat). 
When you have accumulated Status loss past your threshold, you are Dazed; 
you _must_ forfeit action to recover from Shock until all your shock has been recovered.  

You cannot act again until either:
* You have recovered all your Minor Loss (regardless of Wounds)
* Your Status (Minor + Major loss) is brought to or below your Will.

At this point you are no longer Dazed and can opt to attack or recover as desired.

You may "pin" someone who is dazed by continually attacking them. As long as your attack is 
successful, they cannot act _or_ recover status. This is how, for instance, you can 
whittle down a heavily armored foe. 

##### Wounds (Major Loss)

Minor Loss (Shock) can be recovered from relatively quickly. However a single large loss --
one that is greater than your Power -- causes Major Loss. If You accumulate Major Loss
equal to your Power, you lose the contest immediately. 

Example: a long term two-person car race, based on Reflexes (for skill) and Will (for Power) 
goes on several rounds. In a particularly vicious round, Bob (Reflexes 6, Will 5) 
takes a loss of 7. Two of those points of loss are Major Loss; the other 5 are Minor. 

The next round, Bob is Dazed and must recover. If he draws under his Will he recovers
2 points of Minor loss; since his Status is now 5 (3 points Minor, 2 points Major) 
he is no longer Dazed and can compete normally. If not he will be at Status 6 
(4 points Minor, 2 points Major) he is still Dazed and will be forced to recover 
for one more round. 

#### Defeat

You lose a contest if you either accumulate total Loss (Status) greater than twice your
Power, or Major Loss equal to your Power.

In combat, there are other specific effects for crossing thresholds.

       ,         , >Will , >Body    , >2 x Body 
         
Status , Total   , Dazed ,          , KO

Wounds , Total   ,       , Critical , Death
       , At Once ,       , Death    , Mangled
          
Dazed:    Must recover Shock
Critical: Disabled; bleeding
Dead:     See Below
Mangled:  Completely destroyed

#### Unconsciousness

When your status -- the sum of your wounds and shock -- exceeds twice your body, you are unconscious. 
Unconsciousness lasts a few minutes; however, you won't be very effective (Half all skills) 
without a good night's sleep. 

#### Critically Wounded

Wounds past Body are considered Critical Wounds. You fall to the ground, and can no longer defend yourself. 
If attacked again, the attacker automatically hits, so you don't get the power effect from your defense.

Every turn in which you have critical wounds, draw a card:

* If you draw under your Critical Wounds, you bleed for another point of damage. 
  (this is a normal Wound, not critical.) 
  Also, draw a second card under your Will - Critical Damage or pass out. 
* If you draw over your Critical Wounds but under your Body, 
  one point of Critical Wounds stabilizes (and becomes a normal non-critical wound). 

A medic can prevent bleeding by drawing under their skill - the subject's critical wounds. 
If successful, they prevent the bleeding. On a turn in which you do NOT bleed, 
they can attempt to stabilize a second point of Critical Wounds. 

##### Bleeding out

If the sum of your critical and normal Wounds is over twice your body, you die. 
This death can be cured by emergency medicine in a modern campaign, but to any pre-modern
observer, you are an ex parrot.

If a modern EMT is convenient, you continue to bleed out until you reach Body x 3, at which point, 
you are completely gone. However, you will be comatose until you heal back to Body x 2.

#### Death 

Death occurs when you take a single hit causing wounds over your body, 
or accumulate wounds greater than twice your body. 

How dead is dead is something the gamemaster can arbitrate. Monsters and Sidekicks die like
tadpoles. At the referee's discretion, heroes can struggle on as critically wounded 
until they reach Body x 3 wounds; or minimally, if you take a single hit of >Body wounds,
til your wounds is above Body x 2 wounds. 

Mangled, on the other hand, is a dramatic, messy death; 

#### Healing

If you are resting, you automatically heal a point of Wounds every day; 2, if you draw under Body - Wounds. 
If your wounds are greater than your body, you heal 1 point of Wounds if you draw under Body * 2 - Wounds, 
and 1/2 a point of Wounds if you do not. 

If you are under the care of a doctor, they can heal another 1/2 point of wounds every day they draw under their Skill
 - your Wounds. They must spend at least an hour tending you, so a doctor can help multiple people per day. 

### Your Power Bonus

Loss is calculated from a combination of the attackers' sheer power (Body * Weapon Leverage + Weapon Boost (if any)),
adjusted by the suit of their card and the defenders' card. 

The sum of all the above bonuses is added and cross indexed on the scale below. Round up at or past
0.5. Power Bonuses cannot be lower than -3. 

Its best to pre-compute a weapons' effect from -3 to +3. This chart should help:

Power Bonus
                    
PB,     Ratio,   Power
  ,         ,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,   10
  
-3,      1/4,   0,   1,   1,   1,   1,   2,   2,   2,   2,   3
-2,      1/2,   1,   1,   2,   2,   3,   3,   4,   4,   5,   5

-1,      3/4,   1,   2,   2,   3,   4,   5,   5,   6,   7,   8
 0,    1    ,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,  10
 
 1,    1 1/4,   1,   3,   4,   5,   6,   8,   9,  10,  11,  13
 2,    1 1/2,   2,   3,   5,   6,   8,   9,  11,  12,  14,  15
 
 3,    1 3/4,   2,   4,   5,   7,   9,  11,  12,  14,  16,  18
 
To compute basis for powers > 10, use power 10 + power remainder.

For instance: 

A medium Sword (80% body) is used by a person of Body 6; it has power 5. 
Power 5's range on the table below is 

Weapon   -3  -2  -1  (0)  +1  +2  +3

SWORD     1, 2,  3,  (5)  6,  8, 9  Cutting
 
A Warhammer (125% body - 1) is used by a person of Body 6; it has a power 7, and is 33% AP.
Power 7's range on the table below is:
 
Weapon   -3  -2  -1  (0)  +1  +2  +3

WARHAMMER 2,  4,  5,  (7)   9,  11, 12  Hard, AP 33%

The Warhammer seems on a pure power basis to be superior, especially against armor. 
However the cutting weapon will cause more 

### Ranged Weapons

Range (In Meters) 

Ranged Fire is less accurate at distance. The table below describes range brackets in meters. 

RANGE            ,    Point Blank,   Short Range, Medium Range, Long Range,  Maximum

Very Short       ,           NA,    Body x 0.5,   Body x 1,     Body x 2,    Body x 3.
Short            ,    Body x 0.5,   Body x 1,     Body x 2,     Body x 4,    Body x 6.
Medium           ,    Body x 1,     Body x 2,     Body x 4,     Body x 8,    Body x 12.
Long             ,    Body x 2,     Body x 4,     Body x 8,     Body x 16,   Body x 24
Very Long        ,    Body x 4,     Body x 8,     Body x 16,    Body x 32,   Body x 48
Extra Long       ,    Body x 8,     Body x 16,    Body x 32,	Body x 64,   Body x 128

The Body value for powered weapons is the weapons' Boost
The maximum effective Body for range calculation is 10.

For the purposes of this table,

* Pistols have a body of 8; 
* Automatic weapons have a body of 10
* rifles have a body of 12
* rilfes with scopes have a body of 20 if take a turn to aim. 

#### Point Blank range 

your target receives 1/2 defense. However if they are in striking range, your attack skill
is also halved!

#### Medium Range

75% skill (round down) unless you take a turn to aim. 

#### Long Range

50% skill (round down) if you take a turn to aim; 25% skill if you do not. 

#### Notes for weapon table

Blunt,       halve wounds (round down). 
Hard,        (default) Defender's threshold = Body.
Cutting,     defender's threshold for wounds = 3/4 Body
Piercing,    Defender's threshold for wounds = 1/2 Body

Slow,        recovers for 1 round after succesful attack
AP #,        reduce armor by # per 3 points of overkill
D#,          Adds to your defense. Defense -1  if used with sm. Shield
                no extra defense with larger shield.
1 or 2 h,    can be used with either 1 or two hands. 
             Weapons do -1 Power when used one handed
AS#,         Anti-hield Shield's defensive value reduced by the number. 
Draw #,      Takes #/Body turns to draw a new arrow/ready weapon, round up.
Powered,     The weapon is mechanical; its power (and range) don't depend on the
               user's strength. 
Blast,		 Skill is to lob round in target; 1 yard bounce/failure. 
             Power is halved every two yards in open air. 
             Defense is impossible within 2 yards, halved within 4 yards, doubled past 8 yards. 
             

Burst weapons are resolved in clumps of 4. The number of bullets that hit depend on range, 
and the suit of a second card:

Suit,   Point Blank,    Short, Medium ,   Long ,  Maximum

Heart     ,    4   ,    3    ,    2   ,    2   ,    1   
Diamond   ,    3   ,    2    ,    1   ,    1   ,    1   
Spade     ,    2   ,    1    ,    1   ,    1   ,    0   
Club      ,    2   ,    1    ,    1   ,    0   ,    0   

AIMING

If you have a line of sight to your target (or where you know your target is -- i.e.,
the garbage can they are hiding in) you can aim for one or more rounds to increase
your chance of hitting them. 

Once you aim at a target you can fire at any point you want; however you have to wait
until your normal action round to add a card to your aiming for that round.

You can also aim at an area and shoot anyone that comes in, but you will get one fewer
card for area coverage for a 15 degree arc, two fewer cards for a 30 degree arc. 
You can cover up to a 60 degree arc, but you won't get any cards. 

Aiming grants you an extra card per turn of aim at short and point blank range,
per two turns at medium range and beyond. When you fire, you can take the best single
card; on a tie, you must take the earliest card drawn. 

If you have three or more cards, you can take the best COMBO of two or more cards;
on a tie, you must take the one based on the earliest card drawn. 

You can aim for a maximum of (Base Skill /2, round down) rounds. You can maintain 
your aim indefinitely, but you will not accrue additional bonus cards.
 
MINIMUM WEAPON STRENGTH

If you are under strength for a Body it is awkward; or more awkward as it may be.  
it you are at 75% minimum Body or below you cannot use a weapon at all. 

ARMOR

Armor,          Abs,  Boost,    Def,    Msl Def,    Notes
 
Tower Shield,      ,       ,     +3,         +4,    OnBlock, Slow
Large Shield,      ,       ,     +2,         +3,    OnBlock, Slow
Shield,            ,       ,     +1,         +2,    OnBlock

All shields use one hand completely, and cannot be combined with any 2-handed weapons. 
Foils "clever" bonus is lost when using Large or Tower shields.

Plated Kevlar   33%,    +8,    +2,            ,   +4 vs non-bullets

 
The absorption of armor is based on the wearer's body (round on or past 0.5) 
+ an absolute absorption boost. 
OnBlock: defensive benefit only if the defender doesn't overdraw their skill.
Awkward: -25% to users Reflexes/Skill, with a minimum -1 penalty.
Slow: adds an extra round of recovery after a successful attack. When readying a slow 
      weapon you still can defend normally. 
Note - awkward and slow modifiers combine. 

## Bonus Cards (optional) 

To add a little strategy, when you get a face card, you can choose to receive a bonus card
to be played in a later round. To take the bonus face card you must

* Not use it in a challenge
* Not lose a challenge since your last action. 

This only counts when you draw a face card directly from the deck AND when you did not 
draw more than one card that turn. In other words you cannot use Bonuses and acquire Bonuses
in the same round. 

To keep the deck from getting skewed from big hands, you can track your bonus cards with
white chips. which you apply when desired to boost your abilities in a particular round. 

The bonus you get depends on the suit of the card and whether you choose to use it
offensively or defensively. You must commit to use your bonus(es) 
(and announce which are offensive and which are defensive). 

You can choose when/if to reveal and enable their effects
as long as you use them on the same turn on which they are drawn. 

Note, all card effects for multiple bonuses affect a single person; you, or a single opponent. 

The effects last through that round and are discarded at the end of the round. 

       ,    Club,            Spade,            Diamond,           Heart
       
Offense,    Extra Action,    +2 Skill,         Opp. Armor -2,    +1 Power Bonus
Defense,    Slow Opponent,   -2 Opp. Skill,    Armor +2,         -1 Power Bonus to Opp.

### Club: 

#### Extra Action:  

after everyone has acted, you can perform an extra action. You can do
anything you would do normally in an action and receive a new card to act with. 
Your targets must draw a new defense card if necessary. No matter how many clubs you draw
you can never get more than one extra action (with the sole exception noted below). 

If any other hand card bonuses are in play (yours or your opponents) they carry over to 
this extra act phase as well.

The only way that multiple clubs come into play is if you have a slow weapon or a weapon
like a bow that requires reloading. You can use one club to ready your weapon/arrow/etc.
and another club to act on it. Or, you can use it and re-ready it instantly for the next 
round. However even in this circumstances, you can only use two clubs; 
you can't ready, act, and ready again for instance.

#### Slow Opponent: 

your opponent stumbles, and loses their next action. 
They can act defensively, but are immobilized and cannot act offensively during their next act.
