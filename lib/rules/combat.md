# Contests and Combat

Contests are between two people each of whom have a relevant skill and power level; these
are either based on skills, or raw attributes. Note, the average skill/power level is 5
with ranges of +/-3 being normal. 

In a contest, you draw _two_ cards for each contestant. 
* If both cards are above your skill,  you "overdraw" and lose. 
* If either or both card is under your skill, you can use the highest as your rank. 
* If the _sum_ of the cards is under your skill, that is your rank. 

## Fast Attacks

Some weapons get multiple attacks per round; these include pistols, automatic weapons, etc.
Optionally, if you have two weapons in hand, you can gain multiple attacks.
Note, even if you HAVE two weapons, attacking with both weapons in one round is optional 
and must be declared prior to drawing. 

## Two items

In all cases having a second weapon in hand is +1 Defense, except vs. ranged weapons. 
This is true regardless of whether or not you opt for a second attack. 

A second-weapon defense bonus does _not_ apply against ranged/thrown weapons. 

* Anyone can attack with two weapons as long as one of them is small. 
* Because all large weapons are two handed, by definition, there are only two legal two-handed
  options: a small weapon and a medium weapon, and two small weapons. 
  
Also, you may have a shield in your off hand. Shields have a Defense bonus that is determined
by their size. Shields give defense bonuses against all attacks from the front, ranged or hand to hand.

## Minions

Draws can get pretty tedious with minions. For faster play, minions only get one card, get no
bonus for face cards (as in optional rules). If the minions are legion you can even break them into 
groups of four and only draw for every group; as in, "Minion 1, 5, and 9 draws a 4..."

### Swarms 

Some minions are so numerous that attacking individually is not feasible. For them, you can break them into 
swarms, whose base attack rating is augmented by their population. For instance, a herd of kittens 
may only attack at skill 3, but for every 4 kittens, their skill goes up by 1. 

Attacking a swarm is also hard, because they are tiny; they may have a high defense (say, 7) that goes 
_down_ by each additional kitten. You kill one kitten for winning, +1 for every full 2 points of 
marginal success. so if you draw a 10 and they draw a 3, you kill 4 kittens (1 at 4, 6, 8, and 10);

The downside, most armor is not swarm-proof. You get at best 33% of your armor's defense against swarms.

## Card Value

the numeric value of face cards are varying based on the "blackjack rule"; at the holder's option: 

* Aces are 1 or 11
* Jacks are 2 or 12
* Queens are 3 or 13
* Kings are 4 or 14

Note there are some circumstances where the face card is _always_ high; this is noted as a "high draw".

## Skill Modifiers

Sometimes your skill is modified by bonus cards, your weapon modifiers, wounds, etc.
You cannot be penalized past 1/4 of your skill.

The worst defense you can have -- even if you are totally ambushed, blind, etc., is 2. 

## Instant vs. Extended contests

Some contests for simple/mundane tasks can be resolved with simple contests of skil; 
extended contests, like combat, involve depleting the contestants' power pool 
until one of them reaches Loss equal to twice their Power. 

In non-combat contests when you take 2x Power loss, you lose; the last man standing is the victor.

Combat has a more complex system of loss, weapons and armor. 

## Rounds

A round in combat is a second long; in that amount of time, everyone gets a _turn_.

### Movement
 
If you are unengaged you can move up to your reflexes, in Meters, in a round. 
* If you can move in a straight line, you can move up to an opponent 
  and attack at the end of the movement(charge) with a hand weapon.  
* You can move up to a yard and take an action. 

every 10 mph = 4 meter/second; every 7 kph = 2 meters/second. 

### Order of action

For the first round, everyone draws a card; if that card is under your reflexes, you act in descending order 
of the card value. If it is not, you still act on that phase, but do not act on the first round.
Write down the list of actors in order of action. Note overdraws with a parentheses. 

If multiple people attempt to act at the same level, they act in ascending order of skill. redraw to resolve ties.

If there are large numbers (~10+) of identical minions, they can be grouped in clusters of 2 - 4 each to determine order. 
Ideally, break up the clusters so that they are made of minions in different locations to reduce coordinated advantage.

Note there are a lot of complex integrations possible with a team battle, but unless you have two weapons, 
you only have one chance to take action since your last action. If you have a slow weapon,
"taking action" means readying your weapon. 

### Frequency of Action

Whether you attack on your turn or counterattack on someone elses' turn, you still only get one opportunity to attack
each round.
 
#### Frequency of use

From the time _after_ your action up until and _including_ your turn, you can only use each weapon/attack mode once.
Even if you have a fast weapon, like an automatic rifle, you still use it once, resolving multiple attacks.
The exception to that is shields, which can be used (defensively) as many times in this period as its defensive rating; 
medium shields can be used twice, for instance, as they are D2. 
 
You can track usability of weapons and shields by different colored poker chips; for instance, a blue chip
can be used for your primary weapon, and a white chip (or chips) can be used for your shield or off-hand weapon. 
These chips are issued at the end of your turn. 

You can always opt to dodge on your turn instead of using an item to conserve poker chips; only a good idea if you 
are outnumbered. 

After your turn if you use a weapon to attack or defend on someone else's turn, you can't use that same weapon (or attack
that same person) on their turn. 

Slow weapons, when used, become unready. The second time they are used, you are just readying it; no draw is required, 
you just change the status of the weapon. 

For example, Bob and Jon are fighting Rod and Tod. 

The order goes
 1. Bob
 2. Rod
 3. Jon
 4. Tod
 
1. **Bob's turn** Bob engages Rod; Rod opts to engage as well. Rod wins the contest. 
2. **Rod's turn** Rod, because he engaged Bob (since his "last turn") cannot act on his round. 
3. **Jon's turn** Jon engages Todd. Tod chooses to defend, and does so successfully, for no result. 
4. **Tod's turn** Tod chooses to engage with Bob. Bob has the option of engaging Todd; he has engaged 
   _on_ his turn but not _since_ his turn, so Bob could engage Tod now (and lose his turn), but 
   he is having too much fun whaling on Rod so he opts instead to defend against Tod, and engage Rod on Bob's 
   action. 
   
If you have poker chips you can track this by giving each player a blue chip and a white chip _after_ their turn.
* You can act offensively if you have a blue chip. If you also have a white chip, you can draw two cards. 
* You can act defensively if engaged, by spending a white chip. 
* If you have a secondary weapon or shield, you get up to two white chips. 
  You can still attack with at most two cards,  but you can defend (with two cards) on someone elses' turn 
  at a cost of one chip and still act normally on your round. 
* If you have a slow weapon, and you have no blue chips, _after_ your turn, you get two blue chips.
  On your round if you have two blue chips, you can spend one blue chip(to ready your weapon). 
  You can only engage (on your turn or someone else's) if you have _exactly_ one blue chip. 

### Defensive response

If two people engage in a contest, regardless of who started it, both people are considered to act for that turn. 
The exception is that if the person who is acted upon is outnumbered, they may engage in the contest defensively. 
Put another way, if you are attacked by three people, you must defend against two of them and engage with one; 
however, you don't have to engage someone that attacks you; you can choose to respond with a defense only, and attack
another combatant. 

You must declare your choice to respond defensively before you look at your cards. 

If you opt to defend, you can use one of your cards for defense and save the other for your action. 
However, you cannot defend against and attack the same person in the same round; 
i.e., you cannot participate in two contests with the same person in a round.
Alternatively you can use the sum of both of your cards for defense. 

You can choose whether to use one or two cards after looking at your cards. 

* If you successfully defend, you can still act on their turn with the second card. 
* if your opponent wins the contest, you lose their ability to act on their action, and must discard the other card.
  (i.e., if you both overdraw you can still act.)
* If you are playing with a single deck, the defender must return their card to the deck and draws a single card for their action. 

If you are engaged when you have no cards left, you can draw a one or two cards (your choice) 
from the deck in defense; however, if you draw two cards, you _must_ use the sum of the cards, 
or overdraw and lose the contest. 

The option to respond defensively is not available to the person who initiated a contest. 

#### Two Item Defense

If you have a shield or a second weapon in hand, and are outnumbered, 
you can defend one hand to hand attack with two cards on someone elses' action _and_ engage someone _else_ on your action,
also with two cards. Or vice versa; you can engage with someone else on their action, and defend with two cards
on yours. 

### Engagement

Engagement is when you, on your turn, decide to attack someone else. 
* If they have not engaged since their last action, they can decide to counter engage you as well. 
  If this is the case, one or the other of you is going to get hit, unless you both overdraw. 
* If your opponent opts NOT to engage (or cannot as they have engaged someone else since their turn, _or_ have an unready weapon)
  then there are two possible results: 1) you hit them, 2) you don't. 
  
Once you have begun a contest with a person, you can only disengage if 

* your opponent(s) is/are outnumbered by your allies
* all your opponents did not attack you last round, or overdrew their attack.

#### Power Phase

Power is a general term for the attribute that is relevant to the contest. For mental contests the 
attribute is Will; for physical contests the attribute is Body. 

Once the winner is determined, they calculate the effect their conquest has on their target.
Calculate the winner's power (detailed below) and add that amount to the losers' status.

### Power Bonus

The winner receives a power bonus (see below) based on the suit of their card. 
If they have multiple cards they get the _single best_ bonus for any suit in their cards. 
Note -- the power bonus is based on the weapon's power, computed by the power factor;
that is, the power factor of the weapon determines the base power, and then _that_ value
is indexed by the power offset from the contest suit(s). 

Note, regardless of the modifier sums, the maximum range of your power bonus is +/-3. 

Each +/- adjusts the loss the winner inflicts on the loser by 25%; so if your base power is 
8 and your power bonus is 2, you inflict 12 loss on your opponent. 

#### Bonus for suit

The winner's power bonus is based on the suit of the _highest_ ranked card; for this purpose,
Aces and Face cards are high. In the case of a tie, take the last card drawn.

* +0 for clubs
* +1 for spades
* +2 for hearts
* +3 for diamonds

If the defender doesn't overdraw, they get a negative bonus, as described. 

So, the "worth" of the suit of the card depends a lot on whether you win or lose...

#### Loss

Loss is the amount of you lose as the consequence of losing a contest. 

Any single contest in which you suffer loss above your base power; the difference is   
Major Loss (wounds, in combat); the remainder is Minor Loss (or Shock, in combat). 

Note that Loss is a general term for a value that is split between Minor and Major Loss.
(in combat, shock and wounds). 
* Major Loss persists for the length of the contest, and possibly to subsequent contests.
* Minor Loss is short term shock and recovers during the contest; all of it is recovered
  at the end of the contest. 

Your Status is the sum of your Minor and Major loss. 

* When your status (Major + minor loss) is over 2x your Power, you lose. 
* When your Major Loss is over your Power you lose. 

Is this more complicated than a single stack of hit points? Yes; 
however, this makes fatal results rarer and more plausible.
Death is the result of a single extremely powerful hit or several significant hits, 
rather than an inevitable result of all trauma regardless of intensity. 
Low powered combat, or combat with significant armor, 
is far more likely to result in the collapse of the user than a guaranteed fatality. 

##### Damage type and loss

The above rules apply to Hard weapons. 

* Cutting weapons cause Wounds past 75% of your Body (round up). 
* Piercing weapons cause Wounds past 50% of your Body (round up).
* Blunt weapons cause half as many wounds (round down). 

For instance, a person of body 7 takes 8 points of damage. 

* If the damage was hard, they would take 1 point of Wound and 6 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Cutting, they would take 3 points of Wound and 5 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Piercing, they would take 4 points of Wound and 4 points of Shock. 
* If the damage was Blunt, all 8 points would be shock. 

Keep in mind, as described below, ALL loss that puts your status past 2 x Body is taken
as Wounds.

##### Recovery from Minor Loss

You can recover minor loss on your action phase if you have not acted offensively or lost
a contest since your last action. This includes winning a contest you did not initiate.
Even if you take no loss past armor, losing a contest prevents recovery. 

Recovering minor loss requires a High Draw against your base power. In combat it requires a draw
against your Will.

If you have not taken any wounds you recover

* 2 loss if your card is below or equal to your Will. 
* 1 point of Loss if your card is above your Will. 
* 0 points of loss if the card is above 2x your will.

Add any Major Loss to the cards' value. 

###### Dazed

This "Can" becomes "Must" when your Status is greater than your Power. (or Will in combat). 
When you have accumulated Status loss past your threshold, you are Dazed; 
you _must_ forfeit action to recover from Shock until all your shock has been recovered.  

You cannot act again until either:
* You have recovered all your Minor Loss (regardless of Wounds)
* Your Status (Minor + Major loss) is brought to or below your Will.

At this point you are no longer Dazed and can opt to attack or recover as desired.

You may "pin" someone who is dazed by continually attacking them. As long as your attack is 
successful, they cannot act _or_ recover status. This is how, for instance, you can 
whittle down a heavily armored foe. 

##### Wounds (Major Loss)

Minor Loss (Shock) can be recovered from relatively quickly. However a single large loss --
one that is greater than your Power -- causes Major Loss. If You accumulate Major Loss
equal to your Power, you lose the contest immediately. 

Example: a long term two-person car race, based on Reflexes (for skill) and Will (for Power) 
goes on several rounds. In a particularly vicious round, Bob (Reflexes 6, Will 5) 
takes a loss of 7. Two of those points of loss are Major Loss; the other 5 are Minor. 

The next round, Bob is Dazed and must recover. If he draws under his Will he recovers
2 points of Minor loss; since his Status is now 5 (3 points Minor, 2 points Major) 
he is no longer Dazed and can compete normally. If not he will be at Status 6 
(4 points Minor, 2 points Major) he is still Dazed and will be forced to recover 
for one more round. 

#### Defeat

You lose a contest if you either accumulate total Loss (Status) greater than twice your
Power, or Major Loss equal to your Power.

In combat, there are other specific effects for crossing thresholds.

       ,         , >Will , >Body    , >2 x Body 
         
Status , Total   , Dazed ,          , KO

Wounds , Total   ,       , Critical , Death
       , At Once ,       , Death    , Mangled
          
Dazed:    Must recover Shock
Critical: Disabled; bleeding
Dead:     See Below
Mangled:  Completely destroyed

#### Unconsciousness

When your status -- the sum of your wounds and shock -- exceeds twice your body, you are unconscious. 
Unconsciousness lasts a few minutes; however, you won't be very effective (Half all skills) 
without a good night's sleep. 

#### Critically Wounded

Wounds past Body are considered Critical Wounds. You fall to the ground, and can no longer defend yourself. 
If attacked again, the attacker automatically hits, so you don't get the power effect from your defense.

Every turn in which you have critical wounds, draw a card:

* If you draw under your Critical Wounds, you bleed for another point of damage. 
  (this is a normal Wound, not critical.) 
  Also, draw a second card under your Will - Critical Damage or pass out. 
* If you draw over your Critical Wounds but under your Body, 
  one point of Critical Wounds stabilizes (and becomes a normal non-critical wound). 

A medic can prevent bleeding by drawing under their skill - the subject's critical wounds. 
If successful, they prevent the bleeding. On a turn in which you do NOT bleed, 
they can attempt to stabilize a second point of Critical Wounds. 

##### Bleeding out

If the sum of your critical and normal Wounds is over twice your body, you die. 
This death can be cured by emergency medicine in a modern campaign, but to any pre-modern
observer, you are an ex parrot.

If a modern EMT is convenient, you continue to bleed out until you reach Body x 3, at which point, 
you are completely gone. However, you will be comatose until you heal back to Body x 2.

#### Death 

Death occurs when you take a single hit causing wounds over your body, 
or accumulate wounds greater than twice your body. 

How dead is dead is something the gamemaster can arbitrate. Monsters and Sidekicks die like
tadpoles. At the referee's discretion, heroes can struggle on as critically wounded 
until they reach Body x 3 wounds; or minimally, if you take a single hit of >Body wounds,
til your wounds is above Body x 2 wounds. 

Mangled, on the other hand, is a dramatic, messy death; 

#### Healing

If you are resting, you automatically heal a point of Wounds every day; 2, if you draw under Body - Wounds. 
If your wounds are greater than your body, you heal 1 point of Wounds if you draw under Body * 2 - Wounds, 
and 1/2 a point of Wounds if you do not. 

If you are under the care of a doctor, they can heal another 1/2 point of wounds every day they draw under their Skill
 - your Wounds. They must spend at least an hour tending you, so a doctor can help multiple people per day. 

### Your Power Bonus

Loss is calculated from a combination of the attackers' sheer power (Body * Weapon Leverage + Weapon Boost (if any)),
adjusted by the suit of their card and the defenders' card. 

The sum of all the above bonuses is added and cross indexed on the scale below. Round up at or past
0.5. Power Bonuses cannot be lower than -3. 

Its best to pre-compute a weapons' effect from -3 to +3. This chart should help:

Power Bonus
                    
PB,     Ratio,   Power
  ,         ,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,   10
  
-3,      1/4,   0,   1,   1,   1,   1,   2,   2,   2,   2,   3
-2,      1/2,   1,   1,   2,   2,   3,   3,   4,   4,   5,   5

-1,      3/4,   1,   2,   2,   3,   4,   5,   5,   6,   7,   8
 0,    1    ,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,  10
 
 1,    1 1/4,   1,   3,   4,   5,   6,   8,   9,  10,  11,  13
 2,    1 1/2,   2,   3,   5,   6,   8,   9,  11,  12,  14,  15
 
 3,    1 3/4,   2,   4,   5,   7,   9,  11,  12,  14,  16,  18
 
To compute basis for powers > 10, use power 10 + power remainder.

For instance: 

A medium Sword (80% body) is used by a person of Body 6; it has power 5. 
Power 5's range on the table below is 

Weapon   -3  -2  -1  (0)  +1  +2  +3

SWORD     1, 2,  3,  (5)  6,  8, 9  Cutting
 
A Warhammer (125% body - 1) is used by a person of Body 6; it has a power 7, and is 33% AP.
Power 7's range on the table below is:
 
Weapon   -3  -2  -1  (0)  +1  +2  +3

WARHAMMER 2,  4,  5,  (7)   9,  11, 12  Hard, AP 33%

The Warhammer seems on a pure power basis to be superior, especially against armor. 
However the cutting weapon will cause more 

#### Weapon Sizes

The larger the weapon, the more damage it does; see the leverage table for details. However there are
other effects for weapon sizes:

##### Small Weapons

Small weapons do less damage; however they can be used in your off hand with another small or medium
weapon for extra defense and rarely an extra attack. 

Small weapons are -2 defense against Large weapons, unless you have a shield. 

##### Medium Weapons 

Medium weapons are -1 defense against Large wespons unless you have a shield. 

##### Large Weapons 

Large weapons require two hands; 
this means you cannot use a shield or off hand weapon with a large weapon. 

##### Pole Weapons

Pole weapons are like Large Weapons. Only Spears, Warhammers, and Axes can be pole weapons. 
Pole spears do +1 power; other pole weapons do +2 power. 
Pole weapons require one round to lift before being used. This is a variant on Slow; 
there are no exceptions to this - you can't use bonus cards to lift a polearm slower. 
Polearms are +1 to your defense versus all weapons -- even other Pole Weapons. 

Polearms are around 8' long; they cannot be taken in many situations like natural caves, 
dense marshes, etc. because of their great size. On the plus side, their defense bonus applies 
to any allies directly in front of the user, and a polearm user can attack over an ally, at -1 
to their offensive skill. A single polearm user can defend up to two allies at once. 

Polearms provide great overlapping defense. The maximum defensive bonus you get from 
multiple polearms is +2. 

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons allow you to attack faster , longer, and (in modern times) with much greate effect than hand weapons. 

You cannot "get better at" dodging bullets (and for this purpose, arrows). Your defensive rank
vs. ranged weapons is your (Reflexes + 5)/2, round up, if you are aware

If you move you are also much harder to hit; add the square root of your meters travelled if you travelled 3 or more meters,
and if you draw under that with a high card, automatically avoid fire. 

Range (In Meters) 

Ranged Fire is less accurate at distance. The table below describes range brackets in meters. 

RANGE            ,    Point Blank,   Short Range, Medium Range, Long Range,  Maximum

Very Short       ,           NA,    Body x 0.5,   Body x 1,     Body x 2,    Body x 3.
Short            ,    Body x 0.5,   Body x 1,     Body x 2,     Body x 4,    Body x 6.
Medium           ,    Body x 1,     Body x 2,     Body x 4,     Body x 8,    Body x 12.
Long             ,    Body x 2,     Body x 4,     Body x 8,     Body x 16,   Body x 24
Very Long        ,    Body x 4,     Body x 8,     Body x 16,    Body x 32,   Body x 48
Extra Long       ,    Body x 8,     Body x 16,    Body x 32,	Body x 64,   Body x 128

The Body value for powered weapons is the weapons' Boost
The maximum effective Body for range calculation is 10.

For the purposes of this table,

* Pistols have a body of 8; 
* Automatic weapons have a body of 10
* rifles have a body of 12
* rilfes with scopes have a body of 20 if take a turn to aim. 

#### Point Blank range 

your target receives 1/2 defense. However if they are in striking range (< 3m), your attack skill
is also halved!

#### Medium Range

75% skill (round down) unless you take a turn to aim. 

#### Long Range

50% skill (round down) if you take a turn to aim; 25% skill if you do not. 

#### Notes for weapon table

Blunt,       halve wounds (round down). 
Hard,        (default) Defender's threshold = Body.
Cutting,     defender's threshold for wounds = 3/4 Body
Piercing,    Defender's threshold for wounds = 1/2 Body

Slow,        recovers for 1 round after succesful attack
AP #,        reduce armor by # per 3 points of overkill
D#,          Adds to your defense. Defense -1  if used with sm. Shield
                no extra defense with larger shield.
1 or 2 h,    can be used with either 1 or two hands. 
             Weapons do -1 Power when used one handed
AS#,         Anti-hield Shield's defensive value reduced by the number. 
Draw #,      Takes #/Body turns to draw a new arrow/ready weapon, round up.
Powered,     The weapon is mechanical; its power (and range) don't depend on the
               user's strength. 
Blast,		 Skill is to lob round in target; 1 yard bounce/failure. 
             Power is halved every two yards in open air. 
             Defense is impossible within 2 yards, halved within 4 yards, doubled past 8 yards. 
             

Burst weapons are resolved in clumps of 4. The number of bullets that hit depend on range, 
and the suit of a second card:

Suit,   Point Blank,    Short, Medium ,   Long ,  Maximum

Heart     ,    4   ,    3    ,    2   ,    2   ,    1   
Diamond   ,    3   ,    2    ,    1   ,    1   ,    1   
Spade     ,    2   ,    1    ,    1   ,    1   ,    0   
Club      ,    2   ,    1    ,    1   ,    0   ,    0   

AIMING

If you have a line of sight to your target (or where you know your target is -- i.e.,
the garbage can they are hiding in) you can aim for one or more rounds to increase
your chance of hitting them. 

Once you aim at a target you can fire at any point you want; however you have to wait
until your normal action round to add a card to your aiming for that round.

You can also aim at an area and shoot anyone that comes in, but you will get one fewer
card for area coverage for a 15 degree arc, two fewer cards for a 30 degree arc. 
You can cover up to a 60 degree arc, but you won't get any cards. 

Aiming grants you an extra card per turn of aim at short and point blank range,
per two turns at medium range and beyond. When you fire, you can take the best single

# Special Circumstances

## Bonus Cards (optional) 

To add a little strategy, when you get a face card, you can choose to receive a bonus card
to be played in a later round. To take the bonus face card you must

* Not use it in a challenge
* Not lose a challenge since your last action. 

This only counts when you draw a face card directly from the deck AND when you did not 
draw more than one card that turn. In other words you cannot use Bonuses and acquire Bonuses
in the same round. 

To keep the deck from getting skewed from big hands, you can track your bonus cards with
white chips. which you apply when desired to boost your abilities in a particular round. 

The bonus you get depends on the suit of the card and whether you choose to use it
offensively or defensively. You must commit to use your bonus(es) 
(and announce which are offensive and which are defensive). 

You can choose when/if to reveal and enable their effects
as long as you use them on the same turn on which they are drawn. 

Note, all card effects for multiple bonuses affect a single person; you, or a single opponent. 

The effects last through that round and are discarded at the end of the round. 

       ,    Club,            Spade,            Diamond,           Heart
       
Offense,    Extra Action,    +2 Skill,         Opp. Armor -2,    +1 Power Bonus
Defense,    Slow Opponent,   -2 Opp. Skill,    Armor +2,         -1 Power Bonus to Opp.

### Club: 

#### Extra Action:  

after everyone has acted, you can perform an extra action. You can do
anything you would do normally in an action and receive a new card to act with. 
Your targets must draw a new defense card if necessary. No matter how many clubs you draw
you can never get more than one extra action (with the sole exception noted below). 

If any other hand card bonuses are in play (yours or your opponents) they carry over to 
this extra act phase as well.

The only way that multiple clubs come into play is if you have a slow weapon or a weapon
like a bow that requires reloading. You can use one club to ready your weapon/arrow/etc.
and another club to act on it. Or, you can use it and re-ready it instantly for the next 
round. However even in this circumstances, you can only use two clubs; 
you can't ready, act, and ready again for instance.

#### Slow Opponent: 

your opponent stumbles, and loses their next action. 
They can act defensively, but are immobilized and cannot act offensively during their next act.
You can delay an opponent multiple times to keep them stumbling for multiple rounds.

### Spade: 

+2 skill/-2 opponent skill: 

Add or subtract to your/their skill. 
This doesn't affect the value of your card 
but it does increase the range of cards that are valid without overdrawing. 
You cannot lower an opponents' skill below 50% of their base skill with these cards.

### Diamond:

+2 armor/-2 opponent armor;

Increase your armor value (even if you don't have armor. Even if you don't have Armor
you can gain temporary 1 point of Armor Absorption.
If your opponent has no armor to lose, treat as a Heart. 

### Heart: 

+1/-1 Power Bonus. Add this to the Suit bonus value when determine weapon effect. 

### Multiple attacks
  
A multiple attack is successful only if 

* the two cards are sequential in rank (a 4 and a 5, an King (4) and a 3, etc.
* a sequential _descending_ (6, 5) draw is also a succesful attack. 

You cannot both multiple attack and receive a defensive bonus for the second weapon; 
once you multiple attack, until your next action, you don't get to apply a defensive bonus for the 
secondary weapon. 

This is comparable to "splitting" in blackjack; each card is resolved as a successful attack. 
However, if the result of the first attack is you getting hit, your second attack does not occur. 
The good news is, you never get counter-hit twice if you initiate a multiple attack. 

If you are outnumbered, you are forced to use your secondary weapon in defense, and cannot multiple attack. 

You are never _obligated_ to attack multiply; you can always opt to attack only with one weapon, 
and defend with the other one. 

## Multiple Shots

Guns with autofire (assault rifles, machine guns, most modern pistols) attack multiply by design.  
With automatic weapons, each shot(or burst) is a single draw, and with each successive draw your 
skill goes down by 1/2 at PB range, 1 at short range, 2 at medium range, and 4 at long range. 

If you opt to shoot more than once in a round, each shot is resolved with a single card.

If you have multiple guns WITH multiple shots the gun in your off hand is at 1/2 skill.
